# CS3240---Fully-Launched-Web-App
This is a python (django framework) app that was deployed on heroku. The link to the app is : `https://classmate.herokuapp.com/`
-  This was a semester long project that involved 4 other classmates. We also follwoed an agile framework where we had sprint meetings every week. I was the scrum master, and we had a UX person, testing manager, devops, requiruments, and more.
-   But, we all worked together on all of the coding (although the UX person did most of the frontend)
-  BUT, only one other classmate and I did most of the backend coding.
-  This is a study budy app for the students at the University of Virginia. We used an API to pull every class at the school so students can say which classes they are in, and then form a study group with the people also in their class. I reccomend clicking thru the app and seeing all of the fun features!!
-  This app got a perfect score (100%) by the two professors.
