# CS3240---Fully-Launched-Web-App
This is python (django framework) app that was deployed on heroku. The link to the app is : `https://classmate.herokuapp.com/`
This was a semester long project that involved 4 other classmates. We also follwoed an agile framework where we had sprint meetings every week. I was the scrum master, and we had a UX person, testing manager, devops, requiruments, and more. 
But, we all worked together on all of the coding (although the UX person did most of the frontend)
BUT, only one other classmate and I did most of the backend coding.
